For your project, you will mint NFTs! Ok, not really, but we can pretend, yes? You will simulate this by writing some JavaScript code that will create an object that represents your NFT and that will hold its metadata. This metadata can be anything you want, so go crazy! An example of this could be values like name, eye color, shirt type, bling, etc.
